*Data science for me is a game changer in any field that i want to persue, such as: predictive crypto-trading, decision making in business start-up, and collecting and analyzing data for brain-interfaces.*

### The code below defines 3 variables (x, y, z), then performs a serious of calculations, and prints the result


```python
x = 5;
y = 15;
z = 2;

xyz = x * (y ** z)
print(xyz)
```
